"""Pure run-outcome reconciliation — a job status is never the run's verdict.

The incident this closes: an AIDP job reported terminal ``SUCCESS`` while the
run itself had aborted at the in-loop COA gate after landing one bronze table
— and the CLI's ``summary.failed`` check was the only thing standing between
that and a "seed completed" report. This module makes the verdict a pure
function of the run's own evidence, with one hard rule: **a job status of
``SUCCESS`` may only ADD failure signal, never remove one.**

Two callers, ONE completeness definition (:func:`classify_run_completeness`):

* the orchestrator derives the durable ``__run_outcome__`` state row from it
  cluster-side (first-party knowledge of its expected execution set), and
* the CLI applies it laptop-side via :func:`reconcile_run_outcome`, wrapped
  in the R0/R5/R6 rules below —

so the printed verdict and the durable row cannot disagree on the same
evidence.

Everything here is pure: no Spark, no HTTP, no filesystem. ``StepView`` is
deliberately NOT ``RunStep`` — the reconciler has no schema/engine coupling
and both callers adapt their own step shapes into it.

Rules, in order (design §9.1). R5/R6 document the existing exception arms for
completeness — all ``DispatchError`` subclasses already exit 2 before a parsed
summary exists — but are still enforced here defensively:

====  =========================================================  ==========
R0    ``dry_run`` / empty-bundle non-executing summary           planned, 0
R1    any step ``status == "failed"``                            aborted, 1
R2    any step ``skip_reason == "aborted"``                      aborted, 1
R3    any reserved ``__…__`` step with status != success         aborted, 1
R4    an expected node with NO terminal step row at all          unproven, 1
R5    marker missing / degraded (defensive; normally raises)     unproven, 1
R6    ``job_status != "SUCCESS"`` (defensive; normally raises)   aborted, 1
R7    none of the above                                          completed, 0
====  =========================================================  ==========

``AIDPF-4023`` is stamped by the reconciler itself (FR-15.10): always on an
``unproven`` verdict (R4's missing-terminal-row case has no failing step to
extract a code from), and whenever a ``SUCCESS`` job status masked an
``aborted``/``unproven`` verdict.
