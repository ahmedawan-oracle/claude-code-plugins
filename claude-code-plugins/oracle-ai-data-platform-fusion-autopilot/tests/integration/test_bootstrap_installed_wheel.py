"""Installed-wheel mode: `python -m oracle_ai_data_platform_fusion_bundle` must work.

A pip-installed wheel contains the package (`__main__.py` included) but NOT the
sibling `scripts/requirements.txt`, and pip has already installed the deps. The
entry point must detect that mode and run the CLI directly instead of trying to
bootstrap (which would FileNotFoundError on the missing requirements file).

We simulate the wheel layout by copying just the package dir into a temp dir (so
there is no sibling requirements.txt) and running with the current interpreter.
That only models a wheel install when the interpreter *already has the deps* (as
pip would after a real wheel install), so this whole module skips when the
runtime deps are not importable here. The dep-free bypass logic is covered
unconditionally by tests/unit/test_bootstrap_main.py
(``test_main_bypasses_bootstrap_in_wheel_mode``).
