"""Bootstrap's variation-resolution phase.

Runs after the existing pre-onboarding probes (or in place of them when
``--skip-preonboarding-probes`` is set) iff ``bundle.content_pack`` is
non-None. v1 bundles (no ``contentPack:`` block) skip this phase
entirely; their existing ``bootstrap`` behaviour is unchanged.

Responsibilities:

1. Resolve operator identity (Step 5) or raise ``AIDPF-1020``.
2. Load the resolved pack (overlay chain included).
3. Acquire a Spark session, probe bronze once into an ``observed`` dict.
4. Compute ``bronzeSchemaFingerprint`` from the observation (Step 2).
5. For each ``columnAliases.<name>`` and ``semanticVariants.<name>``:
   walk → collect outcome. Never exit early.
6. After both loops complete:

   * If any required no-match outcome was collected → write one
     diagnostic artifact per failure (Step 3), exit non-zero.
   * Otherwise → assemble profile + evidence snapshot, write them
     (Step 4), exit 0.

``--refresh`` semantics (Step 9): re-walk-all every variation point;
no-op only when fingerprints match byte-for-byte. Never emits
``AIDPF-2012``.

    Returns a short reason string when repair is needed; the caller
    rewrites the snapshot atomically using the live probe and surfaces
    the reason in the operator-visible message.

    Repair triggers:

    * **Absent**: snapshot file does not exist. A pre-3d profile, or a

    * **Unparseable**: file exists but YAML / Pydantic validation fails
